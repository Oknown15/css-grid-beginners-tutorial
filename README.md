1 Introduction to CSS Grid
=====================

1.1. What is CSS Grid
---------------------

- `CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system` created specifically to tackle grid-based user interfaces on the web
- `CSS Grid Layout Module` is a CSS3 layout mode that provides an easy, professional and advanced clean way to arrange child elements/items within a container
- CSS Grid is a brand new layout system in CSS! It's not a framework or library - it's an addition to the CSS stylesheet language that allows us to quickly `create flexible, two-dimensional layouts` (with Columns and Rows)
- CSS Grid can be used to `place, size, align, arrange and architect complex layouts/designs` that were previously pretty difficult or even impossible with floats or flexbox
- The Grid Layout Working Draft was published back in April 2011, W3C Candidate Recommendation as of 14 December 2017

1.2. Layout modes
---------------------

Before CSS there were 4 layout modes/models:
1. **`Block`** (for different sections in a webpage)
2. **`Inline`** (for text and spans in the same line)
3. **`Table`** (for two-dimensional tabular data)
4. **`Position`** (for the explicit position of an element)
5. **`Flexbox`** (for one-dimensional grid layout)

### Pre-CSS Grid we have used:
- Different positional properties like `fixed, absolute` to set alignment at the exact required place
- `Floats and clear fixes` to create navigation, detailed section
- Fixed heights columns to show equality
- Above mentioned layout modes does not provide enough flexibility to create/build or design professional/nested/modern layouts
- we need to include another CSS mechanism like Floats, Vertical alignment of text/elements and other hacks with Margin, Padding to create the accurate/desired layout
- `CSS Flexible Box Layout Module (Flexbox)`, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning

1.4. Browser support
---------------------

The CSS Grid properties are supported in all modern browsers:
